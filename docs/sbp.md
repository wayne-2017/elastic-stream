# Streaming Batch Protocol(SBP) v0.1

## Overview

The Streaming Batch Protocol (SBP) is a frame base protocol. All frames begin with a fixed 12-octet header, followed by an extended header and payload. Below graph shows the layout of a frame.

[![Frame Layout](images/sbp_layout.png)](images/sbp_layout.png)

The protocol is big-endian (network byte order).

Each frame consists of a fixed-size header, followed by a variable-size extended header and payload. Section 2 describes the header, while the content of the extended header and payload depends on the operation code specified in the header. Section 4 provides details about supported operation codes and their corresponding payloads. The SBP frame format considers the payload as opaque, which means that it is interpreted by the application layer.

The design of SBP follows two principles:

- Batch: SBP is designed to support batch processing to reduce network communication overhead. This allows clients to send multiple requests in one frame or vice versa.
- Streaming: The server has the capability to respond to requests in a streaming manner, as opposed to responding to all requests at once, which can decrease response latency significantly.

## Frame Header

The Frame Header is a fixed 12-octet header that appears at the beginning of every frame. It contains fields for the Frame Length, Magic Code, Operation Code, Flags, and Stream Identifier.

### Frame Length

The length of the frame is expressed as a 32-bit integer. `Frame Length` = 16 + `Header.length` + `Payload.length`.

### Magic Code

A fixed value representing the protocol self. Currently, the value is 23. This field is used to detect the presence of the SBP protocol, and implementations MUST discard any frame that does not contain the correct magic number.

### Operation Code

The 16-bit opcode of the frame. The frame opcode determines the format and semantics of the frame. Implementations MUST ignore and discard any frame with an unknown opcode.

### Flags

Flags apply to this frame. The flags have the following meaning (described by the mask that allows selecting them):

- 0x01: Response flag. If set, the frame contains the response payload to a specific request frame identified by a stream identifier. If not set, the frame represents a request frame.
- 0x02: Response end flag. If set, the frame is the last frame in a response sequence. If not set, the response sequence continues with more frames. The response sequence may contain one or more frames.
- 0x04: System error flag. If a response frame has the this flag set, its extended header will be type of `SystemErrorResponse`.

The rest of the flags are currently unused and ignored.

### Stream Identifier

A unique identifier for a request frame or a stream request frame. That is, it is used to support request-response or streaming communication models simultaneously. The stream identifier is expressed as a 32-bit integer in network byte order.

When communicating with the server, the client must set this stream id to a non-negative value. It is ensured that the request and response frames will have matching stream ids.

### Extended Header

The extended header starts with format and length fields. The format field is used to identify the serialization format of the extended header. The length field is used to determine the length of the extended header. The length field is expressed as a 24-bit integer in network byte order. The extended header is followed by the payload.

Currently, SBP only defines one format type:

- 0x01: FlatBuffers format indicates that the payload of the extended header is serialized by flatbuffers.

## Frame Definitions

This specification outlines various types of frames, each with a unique 16-bit opcode to identify them. Each frame type has its own specific extended header and payload.

The table below shows all the supported frame types along with a preallocated opcode.

| Opcode | Frame Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| 0x0001 | PING | Measure a minimal round-trip time from the sender. |
| 0x0002 | GOAWAY | Initiate a shutdown of a connection or signal serious error conditions. |
| 0x0003 | HEARTBEAT | To keep clients alive through periodic heartbeat frames. |
| 0x0004 | ALLOCATE_ID | Allocate a unique identifier from placement drivers. |
| 0x1001 | APPEND | Append records to the range server. |
| 0x1002 | FETCH | Fetch records from the range server. |
| 0x2001 | LIST_RANGES | List ranges from the PD of a batch of streams. |
| 0x2002 | SEAL_RANGE | Request to seal a range of a stream. Both PD and range-server serve this operation accordingly |
| 0x2003 | SYNC_RANGES | Syncs newly writable ranges to a range server to accelerate the availability of a newly created writable range. |
| 0x2004 | CRATE_RANGE | Request PD to create a new range for the specified stream |
| 0x2005 | DESCRIBE_RANGE | Describe the details of a batch of ranges, mainly used to get the max offset of the current writable range. |
| 0x3001 | CREATE_STREAMS | Create a batch of streams. |
| 0x3002 | DELETE_STREAMS | Delete a batch of streams. |
| 0x3003 | UPDATE_STREAMS | Update a batch of streams. |
| 0x3004 | DESCRIBE_STREAMS | Fetch the details of a batch of streams. |
| 0x3005 | TRIM_STREAMS | Trim the min offset of a batch of streams. |
| 0x4001 | REPORT_METRICS | Range Server reports metrics to the PD. |
| 0x4002 | DESCRIBE_PD_CLUSTER| Describe placement driver cluster membership |

The below sub-sections describe the details of each frame type, including their usage, their binary format, and the meaning of their fields.

### PING

The PING frame (opcode=0x0001) is a mechanism for measuring a minimal round-trip time from the sender, as well as determining whether an idle connection is still functional. PING frames can be sent from any endpoint.

Receivers of a PING frame set the response flag and the response end flag to do a PONG, with the same extended headers and payload.

### GOAWAY

The GOAWAY frame (opcode=0x0002) is used to initiate the shutdown of a connection or to signal serious error conditions. GOAWAY allows an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new streams while still finishing the processing of previously established streams. This enables administrative actions, like server maintenance.

### HEARTBEAT

The HEARTBEAT frame(opcode=0x0003) is used to keep clients alive, carrying the necessary role and status information.

The client can send a heartbeat frame to the server periodically. If the server does not receive any heartbeat frame from the client for a long time, the server may close the connection, even clean up the resources of the client.

**Request Frame:**

```txt
Request Header => client_id client_role range_server
  client_id => string
  client_role => enum {RANGE_SERVER, CLIENT}
  range_server => server_id advertise_addr
    server_id => int32
    advertise_addr => string

Request Payload => Empty
```

**Response Frame:**

```txt

  streams => stream_id replica_nums retention_period_ms
    stream_id => int64
    replica_nums => int8

Request Payload => Empty
```

Only the stream_id is required in the request frame, the other fields are ignored.

The frame is simple, so the detailed description is omitted.

**Response Frame:**

```txt
Response Header => throttle_time_ms [delete_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail

Response Header => throttle_time_ms [update_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
  update_responses => updated_stream status
    updated_stream => stream_id replica_nums retention_period_ms
      stream_id => int64
      replica_nums => int8
      retention_period_ms => int64
    status => code message detail
      code => int16
      message => string
      detail => bytes

Response Payload => Empty
```

These two frames are similar with the CREATE_STREAMS frame, so the detailed description is omitted.

### DESCRIBE_STREAMS

The DESCRIBE_STREAMS frame(opcode=0x3004) describes a batch of streams from PD. The response frame is similar to the CREATE_STREAMS frame.

**Request Frame:**

```txt
Request Header => timeout_ms [stream_ids]
  timeout_ms
  stream_ids => stream_id
    stream_id => int64

Request Payload => Empty
```

**Response Frame:**

```txt
Response Header => throttle_time_ms [describe_responses]
  throttle_time_ms => int32
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
  describe_responses => stream status
    stream => stream_id replica_nums retention_period_ms
      stream_id => int64
      replica_nums => int8
      retention_period_ms => int64
    status => code message detail
      code => int16
      message => string
      detail => bytes

Response Payload => Empty
```

### TRIM_STREAMS

The TRIM_STREAMS frame(opcode=0x3005) trims a batch of streams to PD.

The range server stores the records in the stream in a log structure, and the records are appended to the end of the log. Consider the length of disk is limited, the range server will delete the records to recycling the disk space. Once the deletion occurs, some ranges should be trimmed to avoid the clients to read the deleted records.

The range server will send the TRIM_STREAMS frame to the PD to trim the stream with a trim offset. The PD will delete the ranges whose end offset is less than the trim offset and shrink the ranges whose start offset is less than the trim offset.

**Request Frame:**

```txt
Request Header => timeout_ms [trimmed_streams]
  timeout_ms
  trimmed_streams => stream_id trim_offset
    stream_id => int64

## Error Codes

The SBP protocol defines a set of numeric error codes that are used to indicate the type of occurred error. These error codes are used in the status.code field of the response header, and can be translated by the client to a human-readable error message.

### System Error Frame

There is a special error frame that is used to indicate that the server encountered an unexpected error or a request-agnostic error. The error frame is sent with the following format:

```txt
Error Response Header => status
  status => code message detail
    code => int16
    message => string
    detail => bytes
```

When the system error flag is set, the above error frame is sent instead of the normal response frame.

### Error Codes Table

The error codes are defined in the following table.

| ERROR | CODE | RETRIABLE | DESCRIPTION |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| NONE | 0 | No | No error |
| UNKNOWN | 1 | No | An unexpected server error |
| INVALID_REQUEST | 2 | No | The request is invalid |
| UNSUPPORTED_VERSION | 3 | No | The version of the request is not supported |
| PD_NOT_LEADER | 5 | No | The requested PD node is not the leader. |
