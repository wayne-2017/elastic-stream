# Cloud Native Design

## Object Storage

1. Unlimited Storage Capacity
2. Affordable via EC
3. SLA(Scalable + Availability + Reliability)

## Storage Advancements in NVMe SSD

1. Millions of IOPS
2. Thread-Per-Core(Run-to-Complete) architecture shifts bottleneck of IO-intensive workload from IO to CPU.
3. Scale with CPU processors

## Separation of Concern

### Separation of Storage and Compute

Scale Independently

### Separation of CP and AP

CP = Consistency + Partition
AP = Availability + Partition

Strong consistency while RTO tends to be zero
RPO = 0 and RTO -> 0
